vLab Inventory API
##################

This service is responsible for creating namespace for a user's virtual machine
inventory. Each user has their own namespace, and under that namespace is where
their virtual machines "live". This makes knowing "who owns what" much easier,
and provides a simple way for users to see all the machines they own.
